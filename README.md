This repository contains my work on the Kaggle House Prices competition. 
The goal was to predict house prices based on various features using machine learning techniques.

## Key Features
- **Modeling Techniques**: Implemented Random Forest Regressor with hyperparameter tuning.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Used Grid Search CV for finding the best parameters.
- **Cross-Validation**: Implemented K-Fold cross-validation for robust model evaluation.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluated model performance using RMSE and MAPE.
